// I 	VARIABLES AND DATATYPES


//A. Q + A

//1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
//First you have to create an object then use curly brackets
//to have a list of variables with their vales.
//Example:
//  const skateboard = {
// 	wheels: 4,
// 	gripColor: "Toy Machine", 
// 	graphic: "Monster graphic",
// }

//2. How do we change the value of a variable?
//By typing:
//nameOfObject["nameOfVariable"] = 'newValue';
//or
//variable = newValue;

//3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// We can do the above (#2) or we can get a value from another
//variable.

//4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
//declare is creating a variable 
//assign is giving values to variables 
//define is putting a function where you want to use it

//5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
//Pseudocoding is writing down in comments what you want your code to
//do before you use it or if you want to reference later after
//you have finished for reference.


//6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how
// you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to
// solve it?
//I think most of the time should be solving the problem first 
//, but when staring off everything might take a really long time.
